    <h2 class="section-title">Short Introduction</h2>
    <p class="text">
      I am a first-year student at Mindanao State University – Iligan Institute of Technology, taking the course of Computer Applications.
      I enjoy learning new things and I love math. Solving math problems has always been exciting and fulfilling for me, and it motivates
      me to think critically and logically as I continue to grow academically and personally.

      <h3>Early Life</h3>
      <p>
        I was born in Marawi City and raised there until the Marawi Siege happened. Because of the conflict, my family had to transfer
        to Iligan City, where I continued my studies. Moving to a new environment was challenging at first, but it taught me many lessons
        and helped me grow as a person. I learned to adapt, become stronger, and appreciate the little things in life. Through all these
        experiences, my family has always supported my studies and encouraged me to pursue my dreams with strength and hope.
